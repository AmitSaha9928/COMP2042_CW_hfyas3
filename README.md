# Introduction
This is the README file for the coursework for COMP2042. The coursework involves performing maintenance on the provided JavaFx project for the game, Frogger, as well as adding extensions to improve the game.

# Maintenence
1. Refactoring the code by putting all the image files and music files into separate different folders.
2. The main menu code is refactored into a new class from Main.java to avoid clutter in the Main.java file and to ensure it is readable.
3.  The help screen code is refactored into a new class from Main.java to avoid clutter in the Main.java file and to ensure it is readable.
4. Performed bugfix on background image not showing.

# Extentions
1. A Main Menu page has been added which will be displayed at the start of the program from which the user can either press spacebar or h. Pressing the spacebar triggers the game to start while pressing h triggers the help screen which tells the user about how to play the game and its controls.
2. A High Score pop up has been added which shows the current score after finishing the level and also shows the all time high score. The all time high score is stored in scores.dat file.
